~Product Stock~
Esta área indica o estoque do produto na unidade. Each box represents one cargo of the product. Each cargo can store a certain number of units of the product.^^The number of units a cargo can hold varies from product to product. For some expensive products, such as cars, one cargo can hold only a few units of the product. For lower-cost products, such as shampoo, one cargo can hold up to several thousand units of the product. This makes the total value of all cargoes of all types of products about the same.^
~Supply and Demand Bar~
The yellow bar indicates the supply of the product by the supplier. The orange bar indicates the demand of the product from the current firm. If the supply bar is shorter than the demand bar, that means there is a lack of supply. Overall firm performance may be affected by the lack of the supply. In this case, you should consider switching to a better supplier.^
~Utilization Bar~
A barra marrom mostra a utilização de cada unidade. If this bar reaches its full length, the unit has reached its full capacity.
