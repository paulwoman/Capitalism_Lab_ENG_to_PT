[Manufacturing Unit]
~Product Name~
O produto que está sendo manufaturado.^
~Product Stock~
Esta área indica o estoque do produto na unidade. Each box represents one cargo of the product. Each cargo can store a certain number of units of the product.^
~Raw Material Stock~
The stocks of raw materials are represented by a row of green bars here. The length of each bar indicates the quantity of the raw material stocked in the unit. During a manufacturing process, raw materials must first go into a manufacturing unit and then converted into products. The manufacturing process is suspended whenever any of its required raw materials is lacking. Thus, to have the unit operating at maximum efficiency, you must provide a consistent supply of raw materials.^
~Utilization~
A barra marrom mostra a utilização de cada unidade. If this bar reaches its full length, the unit has reached its full capacity. It can manufacture no more goods even if there is additional supply and demand. On the other hand, if this bar is short, this indicates that its facilities and resources are not being used effectively. This might contribute to the firm's low profitability.
