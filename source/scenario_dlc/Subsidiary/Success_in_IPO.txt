Title=Success in IPO
Description=The stock market has seen a series of highly successful IPOs (initial public offerings) lately. You see it as an excellent opportunity for your subsidiary companies to raise capital via IPO for funding business expansions. And it goes without saying that the financial reward that you will reap as the majority shareholder is also another great incentive for pursuing an IPO.\n\nIn this scenario, you must set your companies on a sustainable growth trajectory with an eventual goal of having at least one of your subsidiary companies going IPO with a market cap exceeding $1 billion.
